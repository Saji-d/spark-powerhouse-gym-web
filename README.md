Spark Powerhouse Gym is a **web-based gym management system** developed as part of academic practice.  
The project focuses on **backend–frontend integration**, **user account management**, and **structured application flow** using PHP and MySQL.

The application simulates a real-world gym platform at a **conceptual level**, emphasizing clean UI design, session-based authentication, and CRUD operations rather than live deployments or external service integrations.
